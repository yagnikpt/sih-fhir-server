NAMC-ASU.1.1,Jwara,MG21,Fever of unknown or unspecified origin,wider,"Jwara in Ayurveda is a complex systemic condition where fever is the primary symptom, but it encompasses specific pathological states (e.g., Vataja, Pittaja). ICD-11's 'Fever' is a broader symptomatic category, lacking the specific etiological context of Jwara."
NAMC-ASU.1.4,Kasa,PB22,Cough,equivalent,"Both terms describe the clinical symptom of a forceful expulsion of air from the lungs. The scope is a direct match at the symptomatic level, making them equivalent for morbidity coding."
NAMC-ASU.1.5,Shwasa,PB00,Dyspnoea,wider,"Shwasa covers a range of breathing difficulties, from dyspnoea to conditions akin to bronchial asthma. Dyspnoea is the closest symptomatic match but is wider as Shwasa often implies a more specific disease entity in Ayurveda."
NAMC-ASU.1.8,Pratishyaya,CA00,Common cold,equivalent,"Both terms refer to acute viral nasopharyngitis, characterized by symptoms like nasal discharge, sneezing, and congestion. The clinical presentation and scope are identical."
NAMC-ASU.2.1,Atisara,ME05,Diarrhoea,equivalent,"Atisara and Diarrhoea both describe the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. The core clinical definition is the same, making this a direct equivalence."
NAMC-ASU.2.2,Chhardi,MD91,Vomiting,equivalent,"Both terms refer to the forceful, involuntary expulsion of the contents of the stomach through the mouth. The concepts are clinically identical."
NAMC-ASU.2.5,Agnimandya,SF20.1,Indigestion disorder,equivalent,"Agnimandya specifically refers to diminished digestive fire leading to indigestion. This aligns perfectly with the ICD-11 TM2 concept of Indigestion disorder, which represents a functional disturbance rather than just a symptom."
NAMC-ASU.2.6,Amlapitta,SF20.0,Hyperacidity disorder,equivalent,"Amlapitta is the classic Ayurvedic term for a condition characterized by heartburn and acid reflux, matching the definition of the ICD-11 TM2 code for Hyperacidity disorder."
NAMC-ASU.2.7,Grahani,SF22.3,Irritable bowel syndrome like disorder,related-to,"Grahani describes a condition of malabsorption and altered bowel function, with significant overlap with IBS and IBD. The ICD-11 TM2 code for an 'IBS like disorder' is the best fit, acknowledging the similar symptomatic pattern from a traditional medicine perspective."
NAMC-ASU.2.9,Vibandha,ME06.0,Constipation,equivalent,Both Vibandha and Constipation describe the condition of difficult or infrequent bowel movements. The clinical meaning is the same.
NAMC-ASU.4.1,Pandu,3A60.0,Iron deficiency anaemia,narrower,"Pandu is a broader concept than just iron deficiency anaemia; it describes a syndrome of pallor and can be caused by various factors affecting blood quality. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common cause and subtype, making the ICD code narrower."
NAMC-ASU.5.3,Vicharchika,EK70.0,Atopic eczema,equivalent,"Vicharchika is described with symptoms of itching, oozing, and skin thickening, which is a very close clinical match to the presentation of Atopic Eczema (atopic dermatitis)."
NAMC-ASU.5.5,Dadru,1F25.0,Tinea corporis,equivalent,"Dadru is the specific Ayurvedic term for a fungal skin infection characterized by ring-shaped, itchy lesions. This directly corresponds to Tinea corporis (ringworm)."
NAMC-ASU.5.10,Shvitra,ED62,Vitiligo,equivalent,Both Shvitra and Vitiligo refer to the condition characterized by the loss of skin pigmentation in patches. The concepts are identical.
NAMC-ASU.7.1,Amavata,FB51.0,Rheumatoid arthritis,related-to,"Amavata has a unique pathophysiology in Ayurveda involving 'Ama' (metabolic toxins) and 'Vata'. While its presentation of swollen, painful joints closely resembles Rheumatoid Arthritis, the underlying concepts differ. 'Related-to' is appropriate as it is the closest clinical analogue."
NAMC-ASU.7.3,Gridhrasi,SF55.0,Sciatica disorder,equivalent,"Gridhrasi describes pain radiating along the sciatic nerve path, from the lower back down to the leg. This is a direct clinical and conceptual match for the ICD-11 TM2 code for Sciatica disorder."
NAMC-ASU.7.6,Sandhigata Vata,FB52,Osteoarthritis,wider,"Sandhigata Vata is a degenerative joint disorder primarily affecting large joints, closely mirroring Osteoarthritis. However, the ICD code is slightly wider as it can cover osteoarthritis in any joint, whereas Sandhigata Vata classically focuses on specific sites like the knee."
NAMC-ASU.8.1,Pakshaghata,8B21,Ischaemic stroke,narrower,"Pakshaghata refers to paralysis, often of one side of the body (hemiplegia), which is a common outcome of a stroke. Ischaemic stroke is a specific cause, making the ICD-11 code narrower than the broader clinical sign of Pakshaghata."
NAMC-ASU.9.4,Mutrakrichchhra,MF91,Dysuria,equivalent,Both terms describe the symptom of painful or difficult urination. The clinical definition is identical.
NAMC-ASU.11.2,Ardhavabhedaka,8A80.0,Migraine without aura,equivalent,"Ardhavabhedaka literally means 'half-sided splitting pain' in the head, which is the classic description of a unilateral migraine headache. It is an excellent conceptual and clinical match."
NAMC-ASU.11.7,Anidra,7A80,Insomnia,equivalent,"Anidra (loss of sleep) and Insomnia both refer to the persistent difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality. The concepts are a direct match."

NAMC-ASU.14.3,Sthaulya,5B81,Obesity,equivalent,Both terms refer to a condition of excessive body fat accumulation to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. The clinical concept is identical.
NAMC-ASU.16.1,Timira,9B70,Cataract,related-to,"Timira describes a progressive loss of vision due to pathology within the lens, with cataract being the final, opaque stage. Therefore, mapping Timira to Cataract is 'related-to' as Cataract represents the most common and definitive outcome of the Timira disease process."
NAMC-ASU.17.8,Kamala,DB91,Jaundice,equivalent,"Kamala is the Ayurvedic term for jaundice, characterized by yellowing of the skin and sclera due to high bilirubin levels. The clinical sign and the term are direct equivalents."
NAMC-ASU.19.1,Galaganda,5A03,Endemic goitre,related-to,"Galaganda refers to swelling in the neck, which clinically corresponds to a goitre. While it can have various causes, it is most classically associated with iodine deficiency. Endemic goitre is a strong clinical correlate but not a direct synonym, as Galaganda describes the morphology rather than the specific etiology."
